> Remember, not every application on this list you needed, is my reference


#### 1. Cmder
this is best consloe terminal emulator for Windows, i love it. The feature on cmder include git and vim, so you don't need insttalled again. better if you installed powerline interface from blablabla.

#### 2. Visual Studio code
Not my default editor, but the feature on this editor is cool, can use for many programming language and interaction with git too. sadly for dual programming language like html and laravel.blade not supported, so you must choose html first if you want edit the html script then switch to blade if you want to put blade script.

#### 3. Nodejs
i'm used this because i need for developing something with React, express, and download cool tools with connected with js.

#### 4. Office 365

#### 5. Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator
another my job is Design concept web or mobile, i'm fullstack so i need this application to work.

#### 6. Google Chrome
Because i used javascript and other technology web based. Google chorme is the best for debugging web and more tools is greate like POSTMAN to simulate WEB API.
